                    <p class="lead">The Porsche 911 is a two-door, 2+2 high performance rear-engined sports car.
                        Introduced in September 1964 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. It has a rear-mounted
                        flat-six engine and all round independent suspension. It has undergone continuous development,
                        though the basic concept has remained unchanged. The engines were air-cooled until the
                        introduction of the Type 996 in 1998, with the 993, produced from 1994–1998 model years, being
                        the last of the air-cooled Porsche sports cars.</p>

                    <!-- Quoted from Wikipedia!!! -->
                        <p class="lead">The first 356 was road certified in Austria on June 8, 1948, and was 
                            entered in a race in Innsbruck, where it won its class. Porsche re-engineered and
                            refined the car with a focus on performance. Fewer and fewer parts were shared 
                            between Volkswagen and Porsche as the 1950s progressed. The early 356 automobile
                            bodies produced at Gmünd were handcrafted in aluminum, but when production moved
                            to Zuffenhausen, Germany, in 1950, models produced there were steel-bodied. The
                            aluminum-bodied cars from that very small company are what are now referred to as
                            "prototypes". Porsche contracted Reutter to build the steel bodies and eventually
                            bought the Reutter company in 1963.</p>

                            <p class="lead">For 1989, Porsche produced the 25th Anniversary Special Edition
                                model to mark the 25th year of 911 production. The 1989 Porsche brochure lists
                                production of 500 U.S. market cars, of which 300 were coupés (240 in silver
                                metallic paint and 60 in satin black metallic), and 200 cabriolet models (160
                                in silver and 40 in black). All had "silk grey" leather with black accent piping
                                and silk grey velour carpeting. Included were body color Fuchs wheels in 6x16
                                (front) and 8x16 (rear), stitched leather console with an outside temperature
                                gauge and a CD or cassette holder, a limited slip differential, and a short
